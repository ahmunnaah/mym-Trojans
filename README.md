SpaceO is here to bring you the most interesting and interactive platform for space exploration. 
The platform is mainly divided into four parts which are Games, Explore Space, Research and Science Fictions.
Our Gaming section in the website  is connected with our VR and AR game. The Explore Space section will take you in outer space! It includes information regarding all planets out there which are collected using NASA data. In a nutshell, you will get all types of space data in one place. The Research section is developed as an interactive space where users will be able to see the latest data. The Science Fictions part will contain explanations, reviews and discussions about Sci-fi movies.
